## About the App
Wanderer is your go-to android app when you are hiking, trekking or just exploring a place. The app will use your GPS to point out your latitude, longitude, altitude, and address on the go. Next time you feel adventurous, you can just head out without the fear of getting lost. The Google Maps API along with some concepts of Java and Android Studio were used in the making of this application.
